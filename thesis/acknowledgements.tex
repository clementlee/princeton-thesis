\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my advisor, Bernard Chazelle, for all of his contributions to my thesis.
Despite only having found him after the deadline (much to the ire of the COS department), I could not have asked for a better advisor.
Thank you so much for all of your guidance throughout the year, and I hope this thesis is an interesting, if long, read for you.

I additionally give thanks to the Princeton SEAS and COS departments for providing me with funding.
This has been incredibly helpful and I don't believe that my experiments or results would have been possible without it.

Lastly, my thanks and my love go out to my wife Belinda Chen, without whom this work would not have been completed.
You have been there with me not just through this last hectic week, but also in every aspect of my life.
This thesis is dedicated to you, and your otherworldly effort in helping me the whole way.
I love you so much.
